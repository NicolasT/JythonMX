JythonMX
========
JythonMX is a library to export JMX information from Jython applications.

Note this library will only work in Jython, not using CPython, IronPython or
any other runtime.

Quickstart
----------
As a quick start, see the DemoMBean class and main function at the bottom of
the jythonmx module.

You can execute the jythonmx module as a script using Jython. Next, launch
'jconsole', and connect to the Jython process. In the 'MBeans' section, you'll
find the JythonMX MBean with a 'demo' child. You can inspect the attributes and
methods exposed by the DemoMBean, call methods, read argument or attribute
descriptions, change attribute values etc. Take some time to play around ;-)
